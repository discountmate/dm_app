Eventually this Dataset could be used by public for education and other purposes as well. So be part of this great undertaking and contribute by collecting and sharing grocery receipts. You could

2.Take photo of receipts and email to discountmate@gmail.com

Note: When taking photo of the receipts please make sure:
 - the prints are visible and readable. 
 - Photo taken against a clean background
 - If the receipt is too long to capture in one photo fold it take photos of the folds, ideally renaming the folds with common prefix and numbering in sequence in      suffix.
